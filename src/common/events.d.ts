/**
 * This file contains types for the events you want to send between the UI (Panorama)
 * and the server (VScripts).
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: 
 * 
 * The dota engine will change the type of event data slightly when it is sent, so on the
 * Panorama side your event handlers will have to handle NetworkedData<EventType>, changes are:
 *   - Booleans are turned to 0 | 1
 *   - Arrays are automatically translated to objects when sending them as event. You have
 *     to change them back into arrays yourself! See 'toArray()' in src/panorama/hud.ts
